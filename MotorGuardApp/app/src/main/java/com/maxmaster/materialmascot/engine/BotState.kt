 * - Sad: droopy mirrored tilts, soft breathing
 * - Love: round shining eyes, giddy sway
 * - Silly: crossed mismatched tilts, goofball
 * - Egg: egg-shaped body
 * - Hexagon: hexagonal body
 * - Smile: genuine two-eyed warm smile, body lifted
 * - Greet: friendly hello hop with a wave flick
 * - Reading: eyes tracking text lines in slow left-to-right sweeps

 * Playful shape morphs (from bloub):
 * - Play: tumbling rounded triangle
 * - Burst: collapse to pebble with spiral sparkles
 * - Comet: shrink to comet dot with orbiting trail
 * - Orbit: triangle tumble with concentric rings
